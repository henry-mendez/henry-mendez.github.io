Now that I have set up my homelab environment, an Active Directory sandbox is the first thing I want to set up. Configuring Active Directory is currently out of my purview at my current place of employment. Most of my experience in Active Directory thus far has been spent on provisioning new user accounts, modiying group memberships, and resetting passwords. This new environment will serve as the foundation to my homelab as I intend to experiment with various Microsoft and third-party technologies. This includes but not limited to MIcrosoft System Center Suite, PowerShell, and Microsoft 365 integration. 

## What is Active Directory?

Simply put, Active Directory is a directory service that serves the purpose of authentication, authorization, and the management of network resources. 

# Installation and Initial Setup

You first need to set up a domain controller. This is gonna be a server that stores the central database of your domain instance. Another crucial responsibility of the domain controller is authenicating users and computers within a network. You can download Windows Server 2019 [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2019. 

My homelab consists of one ESXi host (currently..). However, you can also use a type 2 hypervisor (VMWare Workstation Player, Virtual Box, etc..). I created my virtual machine using the [system requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/hardware-requirements) shown in Microsoft's documentation.

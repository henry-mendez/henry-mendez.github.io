Now that I have set up my homelab environment, an Active Directory sandbox is the first thing I want to set up. Configuring Active Directory is currently out of my purview at my current place of employment. Most of my experience in Active Directory thus far has been spent on provisioning new user accounts, modiying group memberships, and resetting passwords. This new environment will serve as the foundation to my homelab as I intend to experiment with various Microsoft and third-party technologies. This includes but not limited to MIcrosoft System Center Suite, PowerShell, and Microsoft 365 integration. 

## What is Active Directory?

Simply put, Active Directory is a directory service that serves the purpose of authentication, authorization, and the management of network resources. 

# Installation and Initial Setup

You first need to set up a domain controller. This is gonna be a server that stores the central database of your domain instance. Another crucial responsibility of the domain controller is authenicating users and computers within a network. You can download Windows Server 2019 [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2019. 

My homelab consists of one ESXi host (currently..). However, you can also use a type 2 hypervisor (VMWare Workstation Player, Virtual Box, etc..). I created my virtual machine using the [system requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/hardware-requirements) shown in Microsoft's documentation.

The initial set up from here on out is straight forward. My PowerShell is not strong, yet.. So I opted for the desktop experience.

We then have to configure the network settings. I went with a 192.168.50.200/24 address. After doing some reading online, you will want your hosts to use the domain controller as their DNS server. So what should we set the domain controller with? We can just point it to itself using the IP address of the DC or the loopback address, 127.0.0.1.

Before we create our new forest and domain, we are gonna want to change the hostname of this computer. You can just do this by typing in sysdm.cpl in the run dialog and you'll be able make the change.
